I'm noticing some strange patterns recently. Really strange. Could they be nothing? Sure. They could. Of course they could. At the same time, they might mean something, and in this crazy world being constructed right before our eyes, I tend to view these strange patterns as meaning something.

## **Why Does Pfizer's COVID-19 Vaccine Need To Be Kept Colder Than Antarctica?**

[Source Here](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica)

It has designed its own packaging to keep doses super cold with dry ice, so that they can be stored for a few weeks without specialized freezers (the packaging has been informally nicknamed "the pizza box").

Pizza. Over and over again we're seeing the term being used by those in a position of authority over **OUR** society. Pizza featured prominently in the email obtained by WikiLeaks. A pizza party was the excuse given by Prince Andrew as to why he didn't sweat or why he didn't have sex with a young woman while being photographed with that same woman. It's beyond absurd at this point. I'm not sure about you, but I just can't fathom a food which originated as peasant food is suddenly en vogue for those in high places.

And now we see it here, being used to describe the cold chain delivery process for the vaccines. What does it mean? I have no idea at this point. It might just be coincidence. I just don't believe that it is. And I also don't think the word is tied into sex trafficking. Why? Too easy. Misdirection. Cover up the truth with a basic impulse fear trigger to make us stop asking questions and focus on the wrong topic. Am I positive? No. But I'm skeptical and keeping my mind open to future occurrences of the term. Remember, **WORDS MATTER**. They use them to deceive, and they also use them to talk out in the open, hidden in plain sight.

###### *||"It's a vaccine technology that's so new, no mRNA vaccines have ever been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Because if the information is secret, how can we trust any medical professional saying the vaccines are safe and effective?"||*

###### ||"Because the specific formulations are secret, Liu says, it's not clear exactly why these two mRNA vaccines have different temperature requirements."||

**The specific formulations are secret.** OK. Let's translate: we keep the formulations secret so we can keep maximizing profit instead of saving human lives by sharing knowledge. That's one possible translation. Here's another one: We're keeping this formulation a secret because we don't want anyone to figure out what the actual plan is.

Pro tip. We can't.

## **Over 1 million Israelis who haven’t had 3rd dose to lose Green Pass on Sunday**

Many won’t be able to access certain public places and gatherings without a negative virus test after policy change requiring booster shot six months after 2nd COVID-19 vaccine

[Source Here](https://www.timesofisrael.com/over-1-million-israelis-who-didnt-get-3rd-dose-to-lose-green-pass-on-sunday/)

###### ||Health Ministry data on Monday showed that **4,710,716 Israelis were vaccinated with two doses six months ago, but only    3,243,641 of them have been administered a booster dose.||**

###### ||Even subtracting the hundreds of thousands infected with COVID-19 in the past six months, meaning they wouldn’t need the third             vaccine dose, **the number of people who will no longer have a so-called Green Pass is over a million.||**

Booster shots are the canary in the cold mine. It's the data to see where the future **LIES**. because if the booster shots keep falling, as far as I'm concerned, this indicates the serious adverse events are much more prevalent than our fact checkers have told us (I know, DUH).  They needed a decent sized portion of the population to remain unvaccinated, because if everyone was vaccinated, how could they justify a vaccine passport? Why would they need to prove vaccinated status if almost everyone was vaccinated?

I've been skeptical of the measures taken almost from the start, and the longer this continues, the greater my skepticism grows. This agenda is multifaceted. It's complicated. And in the grand scheme of this **NEW NORMAL**, we haven't even left the starting gate. Remember, one facet of this agenda is increased automation replacing the human labor force, and another one was the **PERMANENT** introduction of the vaccine passport.

We haven't yet reached the levels they want on either of those scenarios. Not even close. And until they do, we have to understand that every move is designed to bring those two strategies into permanence, and we'll need to view any and all future events under a microscope and question everything. Such as the blatantly obvious campaign to divide society into vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Because they've wanted a portion of society to be hesitant from day one.

Bold claims require bold evidence, right? Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't have the evidence, but I do have eyes and a functioning brain, and when my brother pointed this out, I agreed immediately.

And all of those nurses walking off the job because of the vaccine? Say hello to Grace the robot nurse.

## **Meet Grace, the healthcare robot COVID-19 created**

###### ||Separately the ministry announced this week that recovered COVID-19 patients will be required to get a single coronavirus vaccine      dose after they were diagnosed, **in order to remain eligible to receive a Green Pass.** Previously all recoveries were eligible.||

In order to remain eligible. So they were fine with natural immunity before, now, not so much. And this will spread. Have no doubt about it. And what will that mean? More people who can't work because they're plague rats instead of lab rats.

Maybe this will finally answer the question, **DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?**

## **Dr. Ruud Dobber, President of AstraZeneca US and EVP of Bio-pharmaceuticals**

###### ||DOBBER: I think it's optimistic. I think we need to realize that the challenge is enormous. We are talking here about a world population of 7 billion people. But it is good. The moment we have the first doses available of course we are starting to create the herd immunity.||

###### ||Specialist, experts are saying you need to vaccinate roughly 70% of the population in order to achieve that.||

Ah, the start of the famous moving the goalposts. Seventy percent vaccinated will lead to herd immunity. That didn't last too long did it. What are the latest figures? 97 percent of society? I wonder if that's a good idea? Maybe I should take a look around to see if I can find any indications that we should slow down on the **SHOTS FOR DOTS** program.

## **AstraZeneca to be exempt from coronavirus vaccine liability claims in most countries**

[Source Here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-results-vaccine-liability-idUSKCN24V2EN)

###### ||"This is a unique situation where we as a company simply cannot take the risk if in ... four years the vaccine is showing side effects," Ruud Dobber, a member of Astra's senior executive team, told Reuters.||

###### ||With 25 companies testing their vaccine candidates on humans and getting ready to immunize hundred millions of people once the products are shown to work, the question of who pays for any claims for damages in case of side effects has been a tricky point in supply negotiations.||

If the vaccine is showing side effects in **FOUR YEARS**. Right there folks, in black and white. From a top member of AstraZeneca. Remember when the vaccine roll-out first started, and one of the executives (I think it was the Pfizer president) came out and said, don't be alarmed if people die, they die everyday, it doesn't mean that it's the vaccine. Uhm, excuse me? Ok. But then remember how they claimed the side effects only happened in the first fifteen minutes? Then it became, the first couple of weeks? Yeah. **And now we have the executive at AstraZeneca claiming, hey, we can't take the risk of being sued because there might be side effects in FOUR YEARS!**

## **‘Held to ransom’: Pfizer plays hardball in Covid-19 vaccine negotiations with Latin American countries**

[Source Here](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/pfizer-plays-hardball-in-covid19-vaccine-negotiations-in-latin-america/)

###### ||Officials from Argentina and the other Latin American country, which cannot be named as it has signed a confidentiality agreement    with Pfizer, said the company’s negotiators demanded more than the usual indemnity against civil claims filed by citizens who suffer serious adverse events after being inoculated.||

They said Pfizer also insisted the governments cover the potential costs of civil cases brought as a result of Pfizer’s own acts of negligence, fraud, or malice.

That's. Not. **GOOD**.

In Argentina and Brazil, Pfizer asked for **sovereign assets to be put up as collateral for any future legal costs.**

That's. Even. **WORSE**

###### ||One government health official who was present in the unnamed country’s negotiations described  Pfizer’s demands as “high-level bullying” and said the government felt like it was being “held to ransom”  in order to access lifesaving vaccines.||

We. Do. Not. Negotiate. With. **TERRORISTS**.

###### ||In many cases,  adverse events are so rare that they do not show up in clinical trials and only become apparent once hundreds of thousands of people have received the vaccine  (a 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine, for example, was eventually linked to narcolepsy). Because manufacturers have developed vaccines quickly and because they protect everyone in society, governments often agree to cover the cost of compensation.||

Adverse events are so rare they do not show up in clinical trials. So whenever you hear them say, rare adverse events, I want you to remember their idea of rare is one in hundreds of thousands. Does that mean one in two hundred thousand, or one in seven hundred thousand?  And more specifically, we don't know what the adverse events are because they may not have shown up. And may do so in four years time. Which is why they need protection against **FRAUD, NEGLIGENCE, and, MALICE**.

Wait. What?

###### ||Pfizer asked for an additional indemnity from civil cases, meaning that the company would not be held liable for rare adverse effects or for its own acts of negligence, fraud or malice. This includes those linked to company practices — say, if Pfizer sent the wrong vaccine or made errors during manufacturing. “Some liability protection is warranted, but certainly not for fraud, gross negligence, mismanagement, failure to follow good manufacturing practices,” said Gostin. “Companies have no right to ask for indemnity for these things.”||

## &#xA;**Get Your vaccination and save civilization**

###### **||Pfizer’s partner, BioNTech, was given $445 million by the German government to develop a vaccine**

###### and the U.S. government agreed in July to preorder 100 million doses for nearly $2 billion, before the vaccine had even entered Phase 3 trials. Pfizer expects to make sales of $15 billion worth of vaccines in 2021.&#xA;In 2018, a study in The Lancet Global HealthTrusted Source 

###### **estimated the cost of early development and initial clinical safety trials for a typical vaccine to be in the range of 31–$68 million**

###### Large scale trials to determine the efficacy of a vaccine candidate would add to these figures.&#xA;In an accelerated timetable with a new coronavirus, this cost might be higher. For this reason, funding ranging from the government to the private sector is critical in making COVID-19 vaccines.&#xA;“By providing resources and assuming the financial risk, OWS allows companies to  **produce and stockpile vaccine doses even before the company knows if the vaccine is going to work,  **” said Dr. Yager. ||

[Source Here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-did-we-develop-a-covid-19-vaccine-so-quickly)

Stockpile the vaccine before they know it'll work. With over four hundred million dollars, and that figure might be higher for coronavirus, except;

## **The co-founder of BioNTech designed the coronavirus vaccine it made with Pfizer in just a few hours over a single day**

[Source Here](https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-designed-in-hours-one-weekend-2020-12)

###### ||But perhaps most remarkably, BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin 

###### **designed the vaccine in just a few hours in mid-January  **according to The Journal, a podcast from Gimlet and The Wall Street Journal.

###### A BioNTech spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that Sahin — who founded the company with his wife, Özlem Türeci — 

###### **made a "rough design over one weekend."  Moderna's vaccine also took just two days to design  ** as Business Insider previously reported. The reason both candidates could be designed so quickly comes down to the technology they rely on: messenger RNA, or mRNA.||

Ok. Come on.  So they needed over four hundred million dollars to design a drug in under two days!!! But. But.  The clinical trials, you might be saying. Yeah, ok.  Those trials didn't seem to be anything extravagant, just accelerated, so I'm not quite sure why the cost would to test the mRNA would balloon from around forty million to over four hundred million.  And I'm also pretty sure they wouldn't be stockpiling a drug if they weren't positive that drug was going to be used.  In other words, the trials were nothing but a dog and pony show. Plain and simple.

## **Final Thoughts**

Look. None of this adds up in our favor. None of it. And if you thought this all made sense, and then reading this post at least gave you pause, then good. Because these times are unprecedented and unfortunately, utterly unpredictable. Trust the $cience. Which has been bought and sponsored by the same trusted group that brought you **fact checkers and fake news.**

Trust your **GUT**. Use your own reasoning and logic. Why did they change the definition of herd immunity? Why do they suppress any dissenting views and slander them, even though their credentials are impeccable? Sure they manufactured consent this way, but they aslo knew it would manufacture distrust and hesitancy, which I fear is exactly what they wanted. They have almost all the bases covered, and we have to stop tipping our pitches and throw them our own **CURVEBALL.**
